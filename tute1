1. Identify what the instances and attributes might consist of:

(a) Building a system that guesses what the weather (temperature, precipitation, etc.) will be
like tomorrow

(b) Predicting products that a customer would be interested in buying, based on other purchases
that customer has previously made

(c) Automatically identifying the author of a given piece of literature

(d) Finding the best burrito in the United States of America

2. What are the main differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? What
kinds of “concepts” do we typically attempt to “learn” in Machine Learning — for each, identify
whether they are primarily supervised or unsupervised.

(a) Based on the problems in the previous question, identify the “concept” for each one, and
conjecture whether a typical strategy is likely to use supervised or unsupervised Machine
Learning.

For a, Each instance (human, day...) will be a day; depending on how construe the problem, various properties could be attributes
-> The most logical is probably the corresponding data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, etc.) from the previous
day(s). The question suggests that there are multiple concepts (thing we want to predict) here — corresponding to the
various weather features of the particular day that we are trying to predict; assuming that
we can access historical data for the particular location, ML strategy would be supervised regression.


For b, Label every product for every customer as either “interested” or “not interested”, then classification problem.
– If construe a customer as an instance, predict single product (or set of products) that the customer would be interested in. This would be
a supervised problem (probably classification) or unsupervised problem (probably association rule mining, or perhaps clustering).


For c, a single unknown piece of literature and a fixed set of authors who may
have written it — and a collection of their previous writing -> classification problem, 
where we might associate each piece of writing with the words
(or grammatical structure, and perhaps metadata) contained within it;

If an open–domain problem — that potentially anybody could have written it, 
then collecting labelled data would be possible (i.e. classification), albeit obnoxious.
-> use a clustering approach based on the document’s lingustic
properties (-> hard to identify a single author);

For d, need to identify what the instances are:
-> isn't the case that looking for a single unique burrito
Find the “best” one, but rather a particular restaurant (or product from a restaurant) that is consistent “better” than comparable
products from other restaurants.


3. Based on the following dataset1
representation, would you consider “bananas” to be more similar
to “apples” or “oranges”?

(a) Identify the attributes in this dataset. What types of attribute are they (implicity)? What
other attributes might be relevant, and what are their types?

– the obvious interpretation of this data is that the “easy” and “tasty” axes are recording the two attributes for the various instances (of each kind of fruit); however, at
- use the euclidean distance. If there are mmore than one type of a fruit, use their mean value.
