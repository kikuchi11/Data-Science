1. Revise the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
Then, consider the following dataset:

i a i l s LABEL
A 4 0 1 1 FRUIT
B 5 0 5 2 FRUIT
C 2 5 0 0 COMP
D 1 2 1 7 COMP
E 2 0 3 1 ?
F 1 0 1 0 ?

2. Treat the problem as an unsupervised machine learning problem (excluding the id and LABEL
attributes), and calculate the clusters according to (hard) k-means with k = 2, using the Manhattan
distance:
(a) Using seeds A and D.
(b) Using seeds A and F.


3. Repeat the previous question using “soft” k-means, with a “stiffness” β = 1.



4. What is logic behind the EM algorithm, when used for clustering?
(a) Explain the significance of the “E” step, and the “M” step.



5. What is semi–supervised learning, and when is it desirable?
(a) What is self training?
(b) What is the logic behind active learning, and what are some methods to choose instances for
the oracle?
